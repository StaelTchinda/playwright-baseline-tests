# playwright-baseline-tests

A collection of basic sanity checks every site needs: verifying working links, screenshot-based consistency, and error-free pages. Integrate easily, use standalone, or copy needed tests to ensure reliable E2E coverage from day one.

This project aims to serve as a starter kit, allowing you to quickly spin up generic tests and validate core functionality, accessibility checks, and layout consistency across different browsers and devices.

## Key Features

- **Cross-browser support:** Test your site on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Basic sanity checks:** Validate that a page loads successfully, check for essential elements, and ensure no severe console errors.
- **Extensible structure:** Easily add new tests, page objects, and custom functions.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management
